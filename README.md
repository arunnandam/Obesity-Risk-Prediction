# End to End Machine Learning Project for Obesity Risk Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the classification of obesity risk of individuals and classified into categories such as 
- Insufficient_Weight : Less than 18.5
- Normal_Weight : 18.5 to 24.9
- Obesity_Type_I : 30.0 to 34.9
- Obesity_Type_II : 35.0 to 39.9
- Obesity_Type_III : Higher than 40
- Overweight_Level_I, Overweight_Level_II takes values between 25 to 29. 

The aim is to identify and categorize the obesity type effectively so that the user can know the chances of cardiovascular disease. This repository contains the end-to-end development of project that replicates the industry standards.
