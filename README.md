# End to End Machine Learning Project for Obesity Risk Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the classification of obesity risk of individuals and classified into categories such as 
- Insufficient_Weight : Less than 18.5
- Normal_Weight : 18.5 to 24.9
- Obesity_Type_I : 30.0 to 34.9
- Obesity_Type_II : 35.0 to 39.9
- Obesity_Type_III : Higher than 40
- Overweight_Level_I, Overweight_Level_II takes values between 25 to 29. 

The objective is to effectively identify and categorize obesity types, enabling users to assess their risk of cardiovascular disease. This repository encompasses the end-to-end development of a project that adheres to industry standards

## Dataset
The data has features describing the user's characteristics, physical condition, and activities that he perform in a daily basis.
